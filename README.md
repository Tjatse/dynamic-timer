dynamic-timer [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dynamic-timer.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dynamic-timer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tjatse/dynamic-timer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tjatse/dynamic-timer)
=============

Schedule execution of a multi-time callback after delay milliseconds, automatic, intelligence and without bothering, the delay is calculated from different algorithms, e.g.: Lucas Sequence, Fibonacci Sequence, DaYan Series and Arithmetic Procession.

**So, the next `delay` will be generated by the specific strategy, but not a fixed one. This will take a high performance on long-polling, handshake, ping-pong, reconnect, task worker or something else.**

## Installation
```
npm install dynamic-timer
```

- [Test](#test)

## Usage
``` javascript
var dynamicTimer = require('dynamic-timer');
var dynamicTimeout = dynamicTimer([options]);
```

`options` are including:
- **seed** The cardinal number of delay, 1000(milliseconds) as default.
- **delay** The first callback will be called in exactly milliseconds, 1000(milliseconds) as default.
- **strategy** Calculate delay milliseconds by strategy, see more information from [Strategy](#Strategy).
- **maxAttempts** The maximize attempts, the Timer locks `maxAttempts` for different strategy, even when you set the `maxAttempts`, it can not greater than bellows:
  - *procession*  5000
  - *dayan*       141
  - *fibonacci*   20
  - *lucas*       19
- **maxDelay** The maximize delay.
- **overrun** When the attempts greater than `maxAttempts` or next `delay` greater than `maxDelay` means Timer is overrunning, this property should be:
  - **stop** Stop the timer immediately, equals `dynamicTimeout.state.STOP`
  - **reset** Reset the Timer to initial state and start again, equals `dynamicTimeout.state.RESET`
  - **overload** Keep running, but all the next `delay`s will be set to `maxDelay`, equals `dynamicTimeout.state.OVERLOAD`
- **autostart** Automatic start Timer, default as `false`, if the property was set to `true`, there is no necessary to do `dynamicTimeout.start`

## Strategy
Timer supports four strategies:
- **procession**
  Arithmetic Procession, equals `dynamicTimeout.strategy.PROCESSION`, the sequence increases like:
  ```
  1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21...
  ```
  It is increasing placid, so when you set the `seed` as 1000, the Timer will trigger after `1s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 11s...` not insipid `1s, 1s, 1s...`.

- **dayan**
  DaYan Series, equals `dynamicTimeout.strategy.DAYAN`, the sequence increases like:
  ```
  0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, 50...
  ```
  It is increasing placid too, but speedier then *Arithmetic Procession*, I like this algorithm most, so using it as default value for `strategy`.

- **fibonacci**
  Fibonacci Sequence, equals `dynamicTimeout.strategy.FIBONACCI`, the sequence increase like:
  ```
  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377...
  ```
  It is increasing speedy, we can use this strategy to deal with some non-concurrent job.

- **lucas**
  Lucas Sequence, equals `dynamicTimeout.strategy.LUCAS`, the sequence increase like:
  ```
  1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521...
  ```
  *Lucas* is similar to *Fibonacci* but increases speedier.

**Notes:** If you are interesting in these algorithms, you can take a test with the *example/algorithm.js*.

## Events
### tick
This event is triggered after `delay` milliseconds, do your job in the callback:
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.on('tick', function(){
  console.log('#' + dynamicTimeout.attempts, 'next after', dynamicTimeout.delay);
})
```
### toll
This event is triggered after state has been changed.
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.on('toll', function(state){
  console.log('current state:', state);
})
```

## Methods
### start
Start the Timer, when `autostart` set to `true`, this event triggered nothing.
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.start();
```

### stop
Stop the Timer, when current state of Timer was `STOP`, this event triggered nothing.
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.stop();
```

### pause
Stop the Timer, when current state of Timer was not `RUNNING`, this event triggered nothing.
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.pause();
```

### resume
Resume the Timer, when current state of Timer was not `PAUSE`, this event triggered nothing.
```javascript
dynamicTimeout.resume();
```

### reset
Reset the Timer to initial status.
```javascript
// stop timer.
dynamicTimeout.reset(true);
```
The argument indicates whether stop the timer or not, if it was not passed or set to `false`, just reset Timer and tick again from initial status.

## Properties
### attempts
The attempts Timer has run.

### delay
The next delay(milliseconds).

### state
Current state of Timer, including:
- `dynamicTimeout.state.PAUSE`, equals `pause`,
- `dynamicTimeout.state.RESUME`, equals `resume`,
- `dynamicTimeout.state.RESET`, equals `reset`,
- `dynamicTimeout.state.RUNNING`, equals `running`,
- `dynamicTimeout.state.STOP`, equals `stop`

## Example
```javascript
var dynamicTimer = require('../'),
  util = require('util');

var dynamicTimeout = dynamicTimer({
  seed:1000,
  delay:1000,
  strategy:dynamicTimer.strategy.PROCESSION,
  maxAttempts:10,
  maxDelay:4000,
  overrun:dynamicTimer.state.STOP, // stop, reset, overload
  autostart:false
});
dynamicTimeout.on('tick', function (o) {
  util.log('#' + dynamicTimeout.attempts + ', next after ' + dynamicTimeout.delay + ' ms');
});
dynamicTimeout.on('toll', function (state) {
  util.log(state);
});
util.log('start timer');
dynamicTimeout.start();


// test pause, resume and stop.
setTimeout(function () {
  dynamicTimeout.pause();
}, 3000);

setTimeout(function () {
  dynamicTimeout.resume();
}, 10000);
setTimeout(function () {
  dynamicTimeout.resume();
}, 6000);

setTimeout(function () {
  dynamicTimeout.stop();
}, 31000);
setTimeout(function () {
  dynamicTimeout.stop();
}, 32000);
```
